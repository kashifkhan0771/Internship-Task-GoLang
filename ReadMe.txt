To Contenarize(Some issue occur and i cannot push my image to docker hub, but we can create image file easily by using Dockerfile) :
        Run command in root : docker build -t <app-name> .
        And then run command : docker images and your app image will be there.
        To run image Type : docker run <app-name>
Difficulties While Developing the Program:
    As i am a python developer, so i took this task as a challange and learned GoLang as much needed for the task.
    As i was already fimiliar with language like c++ and python and GoLang also has a syntax like them, so i learned 
    the basics quickly and completed the task.
